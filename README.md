Linear Regression for Thriller Movies

# Client / Background
This is my first experience creating a linear regression machine learning model as part of the Metis curriculum. This project also required webscraping which was another first for me. 

The mock business situation that I created for my project: There's a newly created production studio that plans to make movies in the thriller genre. They'd like to know which characteristics of thrillers are predictors of US box office gross.

# Business Questions
- Does a set of features do a good job in predicting US Gross for thrillers?
- Which features are significant predictors of US Gross for thrillers?

# Data to Answer the Question
- IMDB List of Thrillers for target and feature data
- 1100 thriller titles, 16 predictor variables

# Solution Path
### Webscraping
#### Scraped 1100 of the top grossing thriller titles, 16 predictor variables
